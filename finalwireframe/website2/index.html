    <h4>Welcome to my highlighted artwork(s) webpage! I made this extra bit code to feature a few of my styles. <i>I've yet to add all pictures and drawings, so these three are just samples.</i>
    <br>
    <br>
    I apologize for the lack of quality of the pictures. They were taken from my phone, as using a scanner to create a digital image would be impossible with the gear I have at hand. All three pictures are 3D to some extent, with the "Demon Boss" image the heaviest of the three (it is made out of MDF wood... or 'medium-density fibreboard').
